OpenStack Nova
==============

OpenStack Nova provides a cloud computing fabric controller,

OpenStack Nova is distributed under the terms of the Apache
License, Version 2.0. The full terms and conditions of this

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Nova, consult the

For information about the different compute (hypervisor) drivers
supported by Nova, please read:

   https://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/feature_classification.html

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:
