   Unless :oslo.config:option:`specifically enabled
   <workarounds.enable_numa_live_migration>`, live migration is not currently
   possible for instances with a NUMA topology when using the libvirt driver.
   A NUMA topology may be specified explicitly or can be added implicitly due
   to the use of CPU pinning or huge pages. Refer to `bug #1289064`__ for more
   information.
