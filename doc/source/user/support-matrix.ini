# Nova Hypervisor Feature Capability Matrix
# =========================================
#
# This obsoletes the information previously at
#
#  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix
#
# This file contains a specification of what feature capabilities each
# hypervisor driver in Nova is able to support. Feature capabilities include
# what API operations are supported, what storage / networking features can be
# used and what aspects of the guest machine can be configured. The capabilities
# can be considered to be structured into nested groups, but in this file they
# have been flattened for ease of representation. The section names represent
# the group structure. At the top level there are the following groups defined
#
# - operation  - public API operations
# - storage    - host storage configuration options
# - networking - host networking configuration options
# - guest      - guest hardware configuration options
#
# When considering which capabilities should be marked as mandatory,
# consider the general guiding principles listed in the support-matrix.rst
# file
#
# The 'status' field takes possible values
#
#  - mandatory - unconditionally required to be implemented
#  - optional  - optional to support, nice to have
#  - choice(group) - at least one of the options within the named group
#                    must be implemented
#  - conditional(cond) - required, if the referenced condition is met.
#
# The value against each 'driver.XXXX' entry refers to the level of the
# implementation of the feature in that driver
#
#  - complete - fully implemented, expected to work at all times
#  - partial - implemented, but with caveats about when it will work
#              eg some configurations or hardware or guest OS may not
#              support it
#  - missing - not implemented at all
#
# In the case of the driver being marked as 'partial', then
# 'driver-notes.XXX' entry should be used to explain the caveats
# around the implementation.
#
# The 'cli' field takes a list of nova client commands, separated by semicolon.
# These CLi commands are related to that feature.
# Example:
# cli=nova list;nova show <server>

# List of driver impls we are going to record info for later
# This list only covers drivers that are in the Nova source
# tree. Out of tree drivers should maintain their own equivalent
# document, and merge it with this when their code merges into
# Nova core.

title=Evacuate instances from a host
status=optional
notes=A possible failure scenario in a cloud environment is the outage
  of one of the compute nodes. In such a case the instances of the down
  host can be evacuated to another host. It is assumed that the old host
  is unlikely ever to be powered back on, otherwise the evacuation
  attempt will be rejected. When the instances get moved to the new
  host, their volumes get re-attached and the locally stored data is
  dropped. That happens in the same way as a rebuild.
  This is not considered to be a mandatory operation to support.

[operation.live-migrate]
title=Live migrate instance across hosts
status=optional
notes=Live migration provides a way to move an instance off one
  compute host, to another compute host. Administrators may use
  this to evacuate instances from a host that needs to undergo
  maintenance tasks, though of course this may not help if the
  host is already suffering a failure. In general instances are
  considered cattle rather than pets, so it is expected that an
  instance is liable to be killed if host maintenance is required.
  It is technically challenging for some hypervisors to provide
  support for the live migration operation, particularly those
  built on the container based virtualization. Therefore this
  operation is not considered mandatory to support.

[operation.force-live-migration-to-complete]
title=Force live migration to complete
status=optional
notes=Live migration provides a way to move a running instance to another
  compute host. But it can sometimes fail to complete if an instance has
  a high rate of memory or disk page access.
  This operation provides the user with an option to assist the progress
  of the live migration. The mechanism used to complete the live
  migration depends on the underlying virtualization subsystem
  capabilities. If libvirt/qemu is used and the post-copy feature is
  available and enabled then the force complete operation will cause
  a switch to post-copy mode. Otherwise the instance will be suspended
  until the migration is completed or aborted.

[operation.abort-in-progress-live-migration]
title=Abort an in-progress or queued live migration
status=optional
notes=Live migration provides a way to move a running instance to another
  compute host. But it can sometimes need a large amount of time to complete
  if an instance has a high rate of memory or disk page access or is stuck in
  queued status if there are too many in-progress live migration jobs in the
  queue.
  This operation provides the user with an option to abort in-progress live
  migrations.
  When the live migration job is still in "queued" or "preparing" status,
  it can be aborted regardless of the type of underneath hypervisor, but once
  the job status changes to "running", only some of the hypervisors support
  this feature.

[operation.pause]
title=Stop instance CPUs (pause)
status=optional
notes=Stopping an instances CPUs can be thought of as roughly
  equivalent to suspend-to-RAM. The instance is still present
  in memory, but execution has stopped. The problem, however,
  is that there is no mechanism to inform the guest OS that
  this takes place, so upon unpausing, its clocks will no
  longer report correct time. For this reason hypervisor vendors
  generally discourage use of this feature and some do not even
  implement it. Therefore this operation is considered optional
  to support in drivers.

notes=It is reasonable for a guest OS administrator to trigger a

  this operation is considered optional.

[operation.rescue]
title=Rescue instance
status=optional
notes=The rescue operation starts an instance in a special
  configuration whereby it is booted from an special root
  disk image. The goal is to allow an administrator to
  recover the state of a broken virtual machine. In general
  the cloud model considers instances to be cattle, so if
  an instance breaks the general expectation is that it be
  thrown away and a new instance created. Therefore this
  operation is considered optional to support in drivers.

notes=The resize operation allows the user to change a running
  instance to match the size of a different flavor from the one
  it was initially launched with. There are many different
  flavor attributes that potentially need to be updated. In
  general it is technically challenging for a hypervisor to
  support the alteration of all relevant config settings for a
  running instance. Therefore this operation is considered

[operation.set-admin-password]
title=Set instance admin password
status=optional
notes=Provides a mechanism to (re)set the password of the administrator
  account inside the instance operating system. This requires that the
  hypervisor has a way to communicate with the running guest operating
  system. Given the wide range of operating systems in existence it is
  unreasonable to expect this to be practical in the general case. The
  configdrive and metadata service both provide a mechanism for setting
  the administrator password at initial boot time. In the case where this
  operation were not available, the administrator would simply have to
  login to the guest and change the password in the normal manner, so
  this is just a convenient optimization. Therefore this operation is
  not considered mandatory for drivers to support.

[operation.snapshot]
title=Save snapshot of instance disk
status=optional
notes=The snapshot operation allows the current state of the
  instance root disk to be saved and uploaded back into the
  glance image repository. The instance can later be booted
  again using this saved image. This is in effect making
  the ephemeral instance root disk into a semi-persistent
  storage, in so much as it is preserved even though the guest
  is no longer running. In general though, the expectation is
  that the root disks are ephemeral so the ability to take a
  snapshot cannot be assumed. Therefore this operation is not
  considered mandatory to support.

[operation.suspend]
title=Suspend instance
status=optional
notes=Suspending an instance can be thought of as roughly
  equivalent to suspend-to-disk. The instance no longer
  consumes any RAM or CPUs, with its live running state
  having been preserved in a file on disk. It can later
  be restored, at which point it should continue execution
  where it left off. As with stopping instance CPUs, it suffers from the fact
  that the guest OS will typically be left with a clock that
  is no longer telling correct time. For container based
  virtualization solutions, this operation is particularly
  technically challenging to implement and is an area of
  active research. This operation tends to make more sense
  when thinking of instances as pets, rather than cattle,
  since with cattle it would be simpler to just terminate
  the instance instead of suspending. Therefore this operation
  is considered optional to support.

  terminate the existing instance and spawn a new instance with the
  new storage. In other words this operation is primarily targeted towards

  As an alternative to direct attached disks, an instance may
  choose to use network based persistent storage. OpenStack provides
  object storage via the Swift service, or a traditional filesystem
  such as NFS may be used. Some types of instances may
  not require persistent storage at all, being simple transaction
  processing systems reading requests & sending results to and from

[operation.device-tags]
title=Device tags
status=optional
notes=This allows users to set tags on virtual devices when creating a

      metadata, as exposed in the metadata API and on the config drive.
      For example, a network interface tagged with "nic1" will appear in
      the metadata along with its bus (ex: PCI), bus address
      (ex: 0000:00:02.0), MAC address, and tag (nic1). If multiple networks
      are defined, the order in which they appear in the guest operating
      system will not necessarily reflect the order in which they are given
      in the server boot request. Guests should therefore not depend on
      device order to deduce any information about their network devices.
      Instead, device role tags should be used. Device tags can be
      applied to virtual network interfaces and block devices.

[operation.encrypted-volume]
title=Attach encrypted block volume to server
status=optional
notes=This is the same as the attach volume operation
  except with an encrypted block device. Encrypted
  volumes are controlled via admin-configured volume
  types in the block storage service. Since attach
  volume is optional this feature is also optional for
  compute drivers to support.

  not all volume types are supported.

[operation.trusted-certs]
title=Validate image with trusted certificates
status=optional
notes=Since trusted image certification validation is configurable
  by the cloud deployer it is considered optional. However, it is
  a virt-agnostic feature so there is no good reason that all virt
  drivers cannot support the feature since it is mostly just plumbing
  user requests through the virt driver when downloading images.

[operation.file-backed-memory]
title=File backed memory
status=optional
notes=The file backed memory feature in Openstack allows a Nova node to serve
   guest memory from a file backing store. This mechanism uses the libvirt
   file memory source, causing guest instance memory to be allocated as files
   within the libvirt memory backing directory. This is only supported if
   qemu>2.6 and libvirt>4.0.0

  its CPU traits according to CPU mode configuration. This gives users the ability
  to boot instances based on desired CPU traits.

status=optional

  with resource request the virt driver needs to include the 'parent_ifname'
  key in each subdict which represents a VF under the 'pci_passthrough_devices'
  key in the dict returned from the ComputeDriver.get_available_resource()
  call.

  other than the user of the VM. The Configuration and Security
  Guides specify usage of this feature.

[operation.cache-images]
title=Cache base images for faster instance boot
status=optional
notes=Drivers supporting this feature cache base images on the compute host so
  that subsequent boots need not incur the expense of downloading them. Partial
  support entails caching an image after the first boot that uses it. Complete
  support allows priming the cache so that the first boot also benefits. Image
  caching support is tunable via config options in the [image_cache] group.
