# Nova Hypervisor Feature Capability Matrix
# =========================================
#
# This obsoletes the information previously at
#
#  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix
#
# This file contains a specification of what feature capabilities each
# hypervisor driver in Nova is able to support. Feature capabilities include
# what API operations are supported, what storage / networking features can be
# used and what aspects of the guest machine can be configured. The capabilities
# can be considered to be structured into nested groups, but in this file they
# have been flattened for ease of representation. The section names represent
# the group structure. At the top level there are the following groups defined
#
# - operation  - public API operations
# - storage    - host storage configuration options
# - networking - host networking configuration options
# - guest      - guest hardware configuration options
#
# When considering which capabilities should be marked as mandatory,
# consider the general guiding principles listed in the support-matrix.rst
# file
#
# The 'status' field takes possible values
#
#  - mandatory - unconditionally required to be implemented
#  - optional  - optional to support, nice to have
#  - choice(group) - at least one of the options within the named group
#                    must be implemented
#  - conditional(cond) - required, if the referenced condition is met.
#
# The value against each 'driver-impl-XXXX' entry refers to the level
# of the implementation of the feature in that driver
#
#  - complete - fully implemented, expected to work at all times
#  - partial - implemented, but with caveats about when it will work
#              eg some configurations or hardware or guest OS may not
#              support it
#  - missing - not implemented at all
#
# In the case of the driver being marked as 'partial', then
# 'driver-notes-XXX' entry should be used to explain the caveats
# around the implementation.
#
# The 'cli' field takes a list of nova client commands, separated by semicolon.
# These CLi commands are related to that feature.
# Example:
# cli=nova list;nova show <server>
#
[targets]
# List of driver impls we are going to record info for later
# This list only covers drivers that are in the Nova source
# tree. Out of tree drivers should maintain their own equivalent
# document, and merge it with this when their code merges into
# Nova core.

notes=The attach interface operation provides a means to hotplug

notes=This operation allows a host to be placed into maintenance
  mode, automatically triggering migration of any running
  instances to an alternative host and preventing new

  to be a mandatory operation to support.
  The driver methods to implement are "host_maintenance_mode" and

[operation.evacuate]
title=Evacuate instances from a host
status=optional
notes=A possible failure scenario in a cloud environment is the outage
  of one of the compute nodes. In such a case the instances of the down
  host can be evacuated to another host. It is assumed that the old host
  is unlikely ever to be powered back on, otherwise the evacuation
  attempt will be rejected. When the instances get moved to the new
  host, their volumes get re-attached and the locally stored data is
  dropped. That happens in the same way as a rebuild.
  This is not considered to be a mandatory operation to support.

[operation.rebuild]
title=Rebuild instance
status=optional
notes=A possible use case is additional attributes need to be set
  to the instance, nova will purge all existing data from the system
  and remakes the VM with given information such as 'metadata' and
  'personalities'. Though this is not considered to be a mandatory
  operation to support.

[operation.live-migrate]
title=Live migrate instance across hosts
status=optional
notes=Live migration provides a way to move an instance off one
  compute host, to another compute host. Administrators may use
  this to evacuate instances from a host that needs to undergo
  maintenance tasks, though of course this may not help if the
  host is already suffering a failure. In general instances are
  considered cattle rather than pets, so it is expected that an
  instance is liable to be killed if host maintenance is required.
  It is technically challenging for some hypervisors to provide
  support for the live migration operation, particularly those
  built on the container based virtualization. Therefore this
  operation is not considered mandatory to support.

[operation.force-live-migration-to-complete]
title=Force live migration to complete
status=optional
notes=Live migration provides a way to move a running instance to another
  compute host. But it can sometimes fail to complete if an instance has
  a high rate of memory or disk page access.
  This operation provides the user with an option to assist the progress
  of the live migration. The mechanism used to complete the live
  migration depends on the underlying virtualization subsystem
  capabilities. If libvirt/qemu is used and the post-copy feature is
  available and enabled then the force complete operation will cause
  a switch to post-copy mode. Otherwise the instance will be suspended
  until the migration is completed or aborted.

[operation.pause]
title=Stop instance CPUs (pause)
status=optional
notes=Stopping an instances CPUs can be thought of as roughly
  equivalent to suspend-to-RAM. The instance is still present
  in memory, but execution has stopped. The problem, however,
  is that there is no mechanism to inform the guest OS that
  this takes place, so upon unpausing, its clocks will no
  longer report correct time. For this reason hypervisor vendors
  generally discourage use of this feature and some do not even
  implement it. Therefore this operation is considered optional
  to support in drivers.

[operation.reboot]
title=Reboot instance
status=optional
notes=It is reasonable for a guest OS administrator to trigger a
  graceful reboot from inside the instance. A host initiated
  graceful reboot requires guest co-operation and a non-graceful
  reboot can be achieved by a combination of stop+start. Therefore
  this operation is considered optional.

[operation.rescue]
title=Rescue instance
status=optional
notes=The rescue operation starts an instance in a special
  configuration whereby it is booted from an special root
  disk image. The goal is to allow an administrator to
  recover the state of a broken virtual machine. In general
  the cloud model considers instances to be cattle, so if
  an instance breaks the general expectation is that it be
  thrown away and a new instance created. Therefore this
  operation is considered optional to support in drivers.

title=Resize instance
status=optional
notes=The resize operation allows the user to change a running
  instance to match the size of a different flavor from the one
  it was initially launched with. There are many different
  flavor attributes that potentially need to be updated. In
  general it is technically challenging for a hypervisor to
  support the alteration of all relevant config settings for a
  running instance. Therefore this operation is considered
  optional to support in drivers.

[operation.set-admin-password]
title=Set instance admin password
status=optional
notes=Provides a mechanism to (re)set the password of the administrator
  account inside the instance operating system. This requires that the
  hypervisor has a way to communicate with the running guest operating
  system. Given the wide range of operating systems in existence it is
  unreasonable to expect this to be practical in the general case. The
  configdrive and metadata service both provide a mechanism for setting
  the administrator password at initial boot time. In the case where this
  operation were not available, the administrator would simply have to
  login to the guest and change the password in the normal manner, so
  this is just a convenient optimization. Therefore this operation is
  not considered mandatory for drivers to support.

[operation.snapshot]
title=Save snapshot of instance disk
status=optional
notes=The snapshot operation allows the current state of the
  instance root disk to be saved and uploaded back into the
  glance image repository. The instance can later be booted
  again using this saved image. This is in effect making
  the ephemeral instance root disk into a semi-persistent
  storage, in so much as it is preserved even though the guest
  is no longer running. In general though, the expectation is
  that the root disks are ephemeral so the ability to take a
  snapshot cannot be assumed. Therefore this operation is not
  considered mandatory to support.

[operation.suspend]
title=Suspend instance
status=optional
notes=Suspending an instance can be thought of as roughly
  equivalent to suspend-to-disk. The instance no longer
  consumes any RAM or CPUs, with its live running state
  having been preserved in a file on disk. It can later
  be restored, at which point it should continue execution
  where it left off. As with stopping instance CPUs, it suffers from the fact
  that the guest OS will typically be left with a clock that
  is no longer telling correct time. For container based
  virtualization solutions, this operation is particularly
  technically challenging to implement and is an area of
  active research. This operation tends to make more sense
  when thinking of instances as pets, rather than cattle,
  since with cattle it would be simpler to just terminate
  the instance instead of suspending. Therefore this operation
  is considered optional to support.

      For example, a network interface tagged with "nic1" will appear in
      the metadata along with its bus (ex: PCI), bus address
      (ex: 0000:00:02.0), MAC address, and tag (nic1). If multiple networks
      are defined, the order in which they appear in the guest operating
      system will not necessarily reflect the order in which they are given
      in the server boot request. Guests should therefore not depend on
      device order to deduce any information about their network devices.
      Instead, device role tags should be used. Device tags can be

[operation.multiattach-volume]
title=Attach block volume to multiple instances
status=optional
notes=The multiattach volume operation is an extension to
  the attach volume operation. It allows to attach a
  single volume to multiple instances. This operation is
  not considered to be mandatory to support.
  Note that for the libvirt driver, this is only supported
  if qemu<2.10 or libvirt>=3.10.
