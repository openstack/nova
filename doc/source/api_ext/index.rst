In this section you will find extension reference information. If you need to write an extension's reference page, you can find an RST template in doc/source/api_ext/rst_extension_template.rst.

The Compute API specification is published to http://docs.openstack.org/api and the source is found in https://github.com/openstack/compute-api. These extensions extend the core API.
