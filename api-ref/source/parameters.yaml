    Filters the response by a date and time when the image last changed status.
    Use this query parameter to check for changes since a previous request rather

    If data has changed, the call returns only the items changed since the ``changes-since``
    time. If data has not changed since the ``changes-since`` time, the call returns an
    empty list.
    To enable you to keep track of changes, this filter also displays images
    that were deleted if the ``changes-since`` value specifies a date in the last 30 days.

block_device_mapping_v2:
  description: |
    Enables fine grained control of the block device mapping for an instance. This
    is typically used for booting servers from volumes.  An example format would look
    as follows:

      .. code-block:: javascript

        "block_device_mapping_v2": [{
            "boot_index": "0",
            "uuid": "ac408821-c95a-448f-9292-73986c790911",
            "source_type": "image",
            "volume_size": "25",
            "destination_type": "volume",
            "delete_on_termination": true,
            "tag": "disk1",
            "disk_bus": "scsi"}]

    In microversion 2.32, ``tag`` is an optional string attribute that can
    be used to assign a tag to the block device. This tag is then exposed to
    the guest in the metadata API and the config drive and is associated to
    hardware metadata for that block device, such as bus (ex: SCSI), bus
    address (ex: 1:0:2:0), and serial.

    A bug has caused the ``tag`` attribute to no longer be accepted starting
    with version 2.33. It has been restored in version 2.42.
  in: body
  required: false
  type: array
block_device_uuid:
  description: |
    This is the uuid of source resource. The uuid points to different resources
    based on the ``source_type``. For example, if ``source_type`` is ``image``,
    the block device is created based on the specified image which is retrieved
    from the image service. Similarly, if ``source_type`` is ``snapshot`` then
    the uuid refers to a volume snapshot in the block storage service. If
    ``source_type`` is ``volume`` then the uuid refers to a volume in the block
    storage service.
  in: body

block_migration:
  description: |
    Set to ``True`` to migrate local disks by using block migration. If the source
    or destination host uses shared storage and you set this value to ``True``, the

  in: body
  required: true
  type: boolean
  max_version: 2.24
block_migration_2_25:
  description: |
    Migrates local disks by using block migration. Set to ``auto`` which means
    nova will detect whether source and destination hosts on shared storage. if they are
    on shared storage, the live-migration won't be block migration. Otherwise the block
    migration will be executed. Set to ``True``, means the request will fail when the
    source or destination host uses shared storage. Set to ``False`` means the request
    will fail when the source and destination hosts are not on the shared storage.
  in: body
  required: true
  type: string
  min_version: 2.25
boot_index:
  description: |
    Defines the order in which a hypervisor tries devices when it attempts to boot
    the guest from storage.  Give each device a unique boot index starting from ``0``.
    To disable a device from booting, set the boot index to a negative value or use
    the default boot index value, which is ``None``.  The simplest usage is, set the
    boot index of the boot device to ``0`` and use the default boot index value, ``None``,
    for any other devices. Some hypervisors might not support booting from multiple
    devices; these hypervisors consider only the device with a boot index of ``0``.  Some
    hypervisors support booting from multiple devices but only if the devices are
    of different types. For example, a disk and CD-ROM.

network_uuid:
  description: |
    To provision the server instance with a NIC for a network, specify the UUID of
    the network in the ``uuid`` attribute in a ``networks`` object. Required if you
    omit the ``port`` attribute.

    Starting with microversion 2.37, this value is strictly enforced to be in
    UUID format.
  in: body
  required: false
  type: string
networks:
  description: |
    A list of ``network`` object. Required parameter when there are multiple
    networks defined for the tenant. When you do not specify the networks
    parameter, the server attaches to the only network created for the
    current tenant.  Optionally, you can create one or more NICs on the server.
    To provision the server instance with a NIC for a network, specify
    the UUID of the network in the ``uuid`` attribute in a ``networks``
    object.  To provision the server instance with a NIC for an already
    existing port, specify the port-id in the ``port`` attribute in a
    ``networks`` object.

    If multiple networks are defined, the order in which they appear in the
    guest operating system will not necessarily reflect the order in which they
    are given in the server boot request. Guests should therefore not depend
    on device order to deduce any information about their network devices.
    Instead, device role tags should be used: introduced in 2.32, broken in
    2.37, and re-introduced and fixed in 2.42, the ``tag`` is an optional,
    string attribute that can be used to assign a tag to a virtual network
    interface. This tag is then exposed to the guest in the metadata API and
    the config drive and is associated to hardware metadata for that network
    interface, such as bus (ex: PCI), bus address (ex: 0000:00:02.0), and MAC
    address.

    A bug has caused the ``tag`` attribute to no longer be accepted starting
    with version 2.37. Therefore, network interfaces could only be tagged in
    versions 2.32 to 2.36 inclusively. Version 2.42 has restored the ``tag``
    attribute.

    Starting with microversion 2.37, this field is required and the special
    string values *auto* and *none* can be specified for networks. *auto*
    tells the Compute service to use a network that is available to the
    project, if one exists. If one does not exist, the Compute service will
    attempt to automatically allocate a network for the project (if possible).
    *none* tells the Compute service to not allocate a network for the
    instance. The *auto* and *none* values cannot be used with any other
    network values, including other network uuids, ports, fixed IPs or device
    tags. These are requested as strings for the networks value, not in a
    list. See the associated example.

os-availability-zone:availability_zone:
  description: |
    The availability zone from which to launch the server. When you
    provision resources, you specify from which availability zone you
    want your instance to be built.  Typically, an admin user will use
    availability zones to arrange OpenStack compute hosts into logical
    groups.

    An availability zone provides a form of physical isolation and redundancy from
    other availability zones. For instance, if some racks in your data center are
    on a separate power source, you can put servers in those racks in their own availability
    zone. Availability zones can also help separate different classes of hardware.  By
    segregating resources into availability zones, you can ensure that your application
    resources are spread across disparate machines to achieve high availability in
    the event of hardware or other failure. See
    `Availability Zones (AZs) <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/aggregates.html#availability-zones-azs>`_ for more information.

    You can list the available availability zones by calling the
    :ref:`os-availability-zone` API, but you should avoid using the `default
    availability zone <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/configuration/config.html#DEFAULT.default_availability_zone>`_
    when creating the server.  The default availability zone is named ``nova``.
    This AZ is only shown when listing the availability zones as an admin.

OS-DCF:diskConfig:
  description: |
    Controls how the API partitions the disk when you create, rebuild, or resize servers.
    A server inherits the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value from the image from which it
    was created, and an image inherits the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value from the server
    from which it was created. To override the inherited setting, you can include
    this attribute in the request body of a server create, rebuild, or resize request.  If
    the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value for an image is ``MANUAL``, you cannot create
    a server from that image and set its ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value to ``AUTO``.
    A valid value is:

    - ``AUTO``. The API builds the server with a single partition the size of the
      target flavor disk. The API automatically adjusts the file system to fit the
      entire partition.

    - ``MANUAL``. The API builds the server by using whatever partition scheme and
      file system is in the source image. If the target flavor disk is larger, the API
      does not partition the remaining disk space.

      `server` portion of the request body.

    There are a few caveats with scheduler hints:

    * The request validation schema is per hint. For example, some require a
      single string value, and some accept a list of values.
    * Hints are only used based on the cloud scheduler configuration, which
      varies per deployment.
    * Hints are pluggable per deployment, meaning that a cloud can have custom
      hints which may not be available in another cloud.

    For these reasons, it is important to consult each cloud's user
    documentation to know what is available for scheduler hints.

      this will either be a blank persistent volume or an ephemeral (or swap)
      disk local to the compute host on which the server resides
    * ``image``: This is only valid with ``destination_type=volume``; creates
      an image-backed volume in the block storage service and attaches it to
      the server
    * ``snapshot``: This is only valid with ``destination_type=volume``;
      creates a volume backed by the given volume snapshot referenced via the
      ``block_device_mapping_v2.uuid`` parameter and attaches it to the server
    * ``volume``: This is only valid with ``destination_type=volume``; uses
      the existing persistent volume referenced via the
      ``block_device_mapping_v2.uuid`` parameter and attaches it to the server

    This parameter is required unless ``block_device_mapping_v2.no_device`` is
    specified.

    See `Block Device Mapping in Nova <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/block-device-mapping.html>`_
    for more details on valid source and destination types.
