    Filters the response by a date and time when the image last changed status.
    Use this query parameter to check for changes since a previous request rather

    If data has changed, the call returns only the items changed since the ``changes-since``
    time. If data has not changed since the ``changes-since`` time, the call returns an
    empty list.\nTo enable you to keep track of changes, this filter also displays images
    that were deleted if the ``changes-since`` value specifies a date in the last 30 days.
    Items deleted more than 30 days ago might be returned, but it is not guaranteed.

# variables in body
OS-DCF:diskConfig:
  description: |
    Controls how the API partitions the disk when you create, rebuild, or resize servers.
    A server inherits the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value from the image from which it
    was created, and an image inherits the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value from the server
    from which it was created. To override the inherited setting, you can include
    this attribute in the request body of a server create, rebuild, or resize request.  If
    the ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value for an image is ``MANUAL``, you cannot create
    a server from that image and set its ``OS-DCF:diskConfig`` value to ``AUTO``.
    A valid value is:

    - ``AUTO``. The API builds the server with a single partition the size of the
      target flavor disk. The API automatically adjusts the file system to fit the
      entire partition.

    - ``MANUAL``. The API builds the server by using whatever partition scheme and
      file system is in the source image. If the target flavor disk is larger, the API
      does not partition the remaining disk space.

    - ``MANUAL``. The API builds the server by using the partition scheme and

  description: |
    Defines the order in which a hypervisor tries devices when it attempts to boot

    To disable a device from booting, set the boot index to a negative value or use
    the default boot index value, which is ``None``.  The simplest usage is, set the
    boot index of the boot device to ``0`` and use the default boot index value, ``None``,
    for any other devices. Some hypervisors might not support booting from multiple
    devices; these hypervisors consider only the device with a boot index of ``0``.  Some
    hypervisors support booting from multiple devices but only if the devices are
    of different types. For example, a disk and CD-ROM.

  description: |
    The availability zone from which to launch the server. When you provision resources,
    you specify from which availability zone you want your instance to be built.  Typically,
    you use availability zones to arrange OpenStack compute hosts into logical groups.
    An availability zone provides a form of physical isolation and redundancy from
    other availability zones. For instance, if some racks in your data center are
    on a separate power source, you can put servers in those racks in their own availability
    zone. Availability zones can also help separate different classes of hardware.  By
    segregating resources into availability zones, you can ensure that your application
    resources are spread across disparate machines to achieve high availability in
    the event of hardware or other failure.
