    """PCI devices summary information.

    According to the PCI SR-IOV spec, a PCI physical function can have up to
    256 PCI virtual functions, thus the number of assignable PCI functions in
    a cloud can be big. The scheduler needs to know all device availability
    information in order to determine which compute hosts can support a PCI
    request. Passing individual virtual device information to the scheduler
    does not scale, so we provide summary information.

    Usually the virtual functions provided by a host PCI device have the same
    value for most properties, like vendor_id, product_id and class type.
    The PCI stats class summarizes this information for the scheduler.

    The pci stats information is maintained exclusively by compute node
    resource tracker and updated to database. The scheduler fetches the
    information and selects the compute node accordingly. If a compute
    node is selected, the resource tracker allocates the devices to the
    instance and updates the pci stats information.

    This summary information will be helpful for cloud management also.
