Enable or disable guest CPU flags.

To explicitly enable or disable CPU flags, use the ``+flag`` or
``-flag`` notation -- the ``+`` sign will enable the CPU flag for the
guest, while a ``-`` sign will disable it.  If neither ``+`` nor ``-``
is specified, the flag will be enabled, which is the default behaviour.
For example, if you specify the following (assuming the said CPU model
and features are supported by the host hardware and software)::

    [libvirt]
    cpu_mode = custom
    cpu_models = Cascadelake-Server
    cpu_model_extra_flags = -hle, -rtm, +ssbd, mtrr

Nova will disable the ``hle`` and ``rtm`` flags for the guest; and it
will enable ``ssbd`` and ``mttr`` (because it was specified with neither
``+`` nor ``-`` prefix).

The CPU flags are case-insensitive.  In the following example, the
``pdpe1gb`` flag will be disabled for the guest; ``vmx`` and ``pcid``
flags will be enabled::

    [libvirt]
    cpu_mode = custom
    cpu_models = Haswell-noTSX-IBRS
    cpu_model_extra_flags = -PDPE1GB, +VMX, pcid

Specifying extra CPU flags is valid in combination with all the three
possible values of ``cpu_mode`` config attribute: ``custom`` (this also
requires an explicit CPU model to be specified via the ``cpu_models``
config attribute), ``host-model``, or ``host-passthrough``.

There can be scenarios where you may need to configure extra CPU flags
even for ``host-passthrough`` CPU mode, because sometimes QEMU may
disable certain CPU features.  An example of this is Intel's "invtsc"
(Invariable Time Stamp Counter) CPU flag -- if you need to expose this
flag to a Nova instance, you need to explicitly enable it.

The possible values for ``cpu_model_extra_flags`` depends on the CPU
model in use.  Refer to `/usr/share/libvirt/cpu_map/*.xml`` for possible
CPU feature flags for a given CPU model.

A special note on a particular CPU flag: ``pcid`` (an Intel processor
feature that alleviates guest performance degradation as a result of
applying the 'Meltdown' CVE fixes).  When configuring this flag with the
``custom`` CPU mode, not all CPU models (as defined by QEMU and libvirt)
need it:

* The only virtual CPU models that include the ``pcid`` capability are
  Intel "Haswell", "Broadwell", and "Skylake" variants.

* The libvirt / QEMU CPU models "Nehalem", "Westmere", "SandyBridge",
  and "IvyBridge" will _not_ expose the ``pcid`` capability by default,
  even if the host CPUs by the same name include it.  I.e. 'PCID' needs
  to be explicitly specified when using the said virtual CPU models.

The libvirt driver's default CPU mode, ``host-model``, will do the right
thing with respect to handling 'PCID' CPU flag for the guest --
*assuming* you are running updated processor microcode, host and guest
kernel, libvirt, and QEMU.  The other mode, ``host-passthrough``, checks
if 'PCID' is available in the hardware, and if so directly passes it
through to the Nova guests.  Thus, in context of 'PCID', with either of
these CPU modes (``host-model`` or ``host-passthrough``), there is no
need to use the ``cpu_model_extra_flags``.

I/O performance for applications running in the guest, especially for read
operations. However, caching mode none is recommended for remote NFS storage,
because direct I/O operations (O_DIRECT) perform better than synchronous I/O
operations (with O_SYNC). Caching mode none effectively turns all guest I/O
operations into direct I/O operations on the host, which is the NFS client in
this environment.

Possible cache modes:

* default: "It Depends" -- For Nova-managed disks, ``none``, if the host
  file system is capable of Linux's 'O_DIRECT' semantics; otherwise
  ``writeback``.  For volume drivers, the default is driver-dependent:
  ``none`` for everything except for SMBFS and Virtuzzo (which use
  ``writeback``).
* none: With caching mode set to none, the host page cache is disabled, but
  the disk write cache is enabled for the guest. In this mode, the write
  performance in the guest is optimal because write operations bypass the host
  page cache and go directly to the disk write cache. If the disk write cache
  is battery-backed, or if the applications or storage stack in the guest
  transfer data properly (either through fsync operations or file system
  barriers), then data integrity can be ensured. However, because the host
  page cache is disabled, the read performance in the guest would not be as
  good as in the modes where the host page cache is enabled, such as
  writethrough mode. Shareable disk devices, like for a multi-attachable block
  storage volume, will have their cache mode set to 'none' regardless of
  configuration.
* writethrough: With caching set to writethrough mode, the host page cache is
  enabled, but the disk write cache is disabled for the guest. Consequently,
  this caching mode ensures data integrity even if the applications and storage
  stack in the guest do not transfer data to permanent storage properly (either
  through fsync operations or file system barriers). Because the host page
  cache is enabled in this mode, the read performance for applications running
  in the guest is generally better. However, the write performance might be
  reduced because the disk write cache is disabled.
* writeback: With caching set to writeback mode, both the host page
  cache and the disk write cache are enabled for the guest. Because of
  this, the I/O performance for applications running in the guest is
  good, but the data is not protected in a power failure. As a result,
  this caching mode is recommended only for temporary data where
  potential data loss is not a concern.
  NOTE: Certain backend disk mechanisms may provide safe
  writeback cache semantics. Specifically those that bypass the host
  page cache, such as QEMU's integrated RBD driver. Ceph documentation
  recommends setting this to writeback for maximum performance while
  maintaining data safety.
* directsync: Like "writethrough", but it bypasses the host page cache.
* unsafe: Caching mode of unsafe ignores cache transfer operations
  completely. As its name implies, this caching mode should be used only for
  temporary data where data loss is not a concern. This mode can be useful for
  speeding up guest installations, but you should switch to another caching
  mode in production environments.
