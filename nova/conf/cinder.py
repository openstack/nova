Allow attach between instance and volume in different availability zones.

If False, volumes attached to an instance must be in the same availability
zone in Cinder as the instance availability zone in Nova.

This also means care should be taken when booting an instance from a volume
where source is not "volume" because Nova will attempt to create a volume using
the same availability zone as what is assigned to the instance.

If that AZ is not in Cinder (or ``allow_availability_zone_fallback=False`` in
cinder.conf), the volume create request will fail and the instance will fail
the build request.

By default there is no availability zone restriction on volume attach.

Additional time to give Cinder to migrate a volume in seconds

When Nova is waiting for a volume-migration to finish, the time is expected to
rise with the size of the volume. Therefore, we employ a simple computation
using min_migration_speed_mib_per_second to get an upper bound for the waiting
time. With really small volumes, the overhead of migration is longer than the
overhead of copying the data and thus the computed migration time is too low.
To handle these cases, we add migration_overhead to increase the lower bound
for the time Nova waits.

Possible values:

  * Positive Integer value
