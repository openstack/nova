Determine if the source compute host should wait for a ``network-vif-plugged``

Note that this option is read on the destination host of a live migration.
If you set this option the same on all of your compute hosts, which you should
do if you use the same networking backend universally, you do not have to
worry about this.

Before starting the transfer of the guest, some setup occurs on the destination
compute host, including plugging virtual interfaces. Depending on the
networking backend **on the destination host**, a ``network-vif-plugged``
event may be triggered and then received on the source compute host and the
source compute can wait for that event to ensure networking is set up on the
destination host before starting the guest transfer in the hypervisor.

.. note::

   The compute service cannot reliably determine which types of virtual
   interfaces (``port.binding:vif_type``) will send ``network-vif-plugged``
   events without an accompanying port ``binding:host_id`` change.
   Open vSwitch and linuxbridge should be OK, but OpenDaylight is at least
   one known backend that will not currently work in this case, see bug

Maximum number of disk devices allowed to attach to a single server. Note
that the number of disks supported by an server depends on the bus used. For
example, the ``ide`` disk bus is limited to 4 attached devices. The configured
maximum is enforced during server create, rebuild, evacuate, unshelve, live
migrate, and attach volume.

Usually, disk bus is determined automatically from the device type or disk
device, and the virtualization type. However, disk bus
can also be specified via a block device mapping or an image property.
See the ``disk_bus`` field in :doc:`/user/block-device-mapping` for more
information about specifying disk bus in a block device mapping, and
see https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/useful-image-properties.html
for more information about the ``hw_disk_bus`` image property.

Operators changing the ``[compute]/max_disk_devices_to_attach`` on a compute
service that is hosting servers should be aware that it could cause rebuilds to
fail, if the maximum is decreased lower than the number of devices already
attached to servers. For example, if server A has 26 devices attached and an
operators changes ``[compute]/max_disk_devices_to_attach`` to 20, a request to
rebuild server A will fail and go into ERROR state because 26 devices are
already attached and exceed the new configured maximum of 20.

Operators setting ``[compute]/max_disk_devices_to_attach`` should also be aware
that during a cold migration, the configured maximum is only enforced in-place
and the destination is not checked before the move. This means if an operator
has set a maximum of 26 on compute host A and a maximum of 20 on compute host
B, a cold migration of a server with 26 attached devices from compute host A to
compute host B will succeed. Then, once the server is on compute host B, a
subsequent request to rebuild the server will fail and go into ERROR state
because 26 devices are already attached and exceed the configured maximum of 20
on compute host B.

The configured maximum is not enforced on shelved offloaded servers, as they
have no compute host.
