Time period to generate instance usages for. It is possible to define optional
offset to given period by appending @ character followed by a number defining
offset.

Possible values:

*  period, example: ``hour``, ``day``, ``month` or ``year``
*  period with offset, example: ``month@15`` will result in monthly audits
   starting on 15th day of month.

Start and use a daemon that can run the commands that need to be run with
root privileges. This option is usually enabled on nodes that run nova compute
processes.

Path to the rootwrap configuration file.

Goal of the root wrapper is to allow a service-specific unprivileged user to
run a number of actions as the root user in the safest manner possible.
The configuration file used here must match the one defined in the sudoers
entry.

Instance memory usage identifying it as big VM

For a couple of operations, e.g. scheduling decisions and special settings when
spawning, we have to identify a big VM and handle them differently. Every VM
having more or equal to this setting's amount of RAM is a big VM.
