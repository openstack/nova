Enable handling of events emitted from compute drivers.

Many compute drivers emit lifecycle events, which are events that occur when,
for example, an instance is starting or stopping. If the instance is going
through task state changes due to an API operation, like resize, the events
are ignored.

This is an advanced feature which allows the hypervisor to signal to the
compute service that an unexpected state change has occurred in an instance
and that the instance can be shutdown automatically. Unfortunately, this can
race in some conditions, for example in reboot operations or when the compute
service or when host is rebooted (planned or due to an outage). If such races
are common, then it is advisable to disable this feature.

Care should be taken when this feature is disabled and
'sync_power_state_interval' is set to a negative value. In this case, any
instances that get out of sync between the hypervisor and the Nova database
will have to be synchronized manually.

Disable the server group policy check upcall in compute.

In order to detect races with server group affinity policy, the compute
service attempts to validate that the policy was not violated by the
scheduler. It does this by making an upcall to the API database to list
the instances in the server group for one that it is booting, which violates
our api/cell isolation goals. Eventually this will be solved by proper affinity
guarantees in the scheduler and placement service, but until then, this late
check is needed to ensure proper affinity policy.

enable this flag, which will avoid making that upcall from compute.

Enable live migration of instances with NUMA topologies.

Live migration of instances with NUMA topologies when using the libvirt driver
is only supported in deployments that have been fully upgraded to Train. In
previous versions, or in mixed Stein/Train deployments with a rolling upgrade
in progress, live migration of instances with NUMA topologies is disabled by
default when using the libvirt driver. This includes live migration of
instances with CPU pinning or hugepages. CPU pinning and huge page information
for such instances is not currently re-calculated, as noted in `bug #1289064`_.
This means that if instances were already present on the destination host, the
migrated instance could be placed on the same dedicated cores as these
instances or use hugepages allocated for another instance. Alternately, if the
host platforms were not homogeneous, the instance could be assigned to
non-existent cores or be inadvertently split across host NUMA nodes.

Disable fallback request for VCPU allocations when using pinned instances.

Starting in Train, compute nodes using the libvirt virt driver can report
``PCPU`` inventory and will use this for pinned instances. The scheduler will

extra specs, ``hw:cpu_policy`` and ``hw:cpu_thread_policy``, their image
metadata property equivalents, and the emulator threads pinning flavor extra
spec, ``hw:emulator_threads_policy``, to new placement requests. However,
compute nodes require additional configuration in order to report ``PCPU``
inventory and this configuration may not be present immediately after an
upgrade. To ensure pinned instances can be created without this additional
configuration, the scheduler will make a second request to placement for
old-style ``VCPU``-based allocations and fallback to these allocation
candidates if necessary. This has a slight performance impact and is not
necessary on new or upgraded deployments where the new configuration has been
set on all hosts. By setting this option, the second lookup is disabled and the

The libvirt virt driver implements power on and hard reboot by tearing down
every vif of the instance being rebooted then plug them again. By default nova
does not wait for network-vif-plugged event from neutron before it lets the
instance run. This can cause the instance to requests the IP via DHCP before
the neutron backend has a chance to set up the networking backend after the vif
plug.

This flag defines which vifs nova expects network-vif-plugged events from
during hard reboot. The possible values are neutron port vnic types:

* normal
* direct
* macvtap
* baremetal
* direct-physical
* virtio-forwarder
* smart-nic
* vdpa
* accelerator-direct
* accelerator-direct-physical
* remote-managed

Adding a ``vnic_type`` to this configuration makes Nova wait for a
network-vif-plugged event for each of the instance's vifs having the specific
``vnic_type`` before unpausing the instance, similarly to how new instance
creation works.

Please note that not all neutron networking backends send plug time events, for
certain ``vnic_type`` therefore this config is empty by default.

The ml2/ovs and the networking-odl backends are known to send plug time events
for ports with ``normal`` ``vnic_type`` so it is safe to add ``normal`` to this
config if you are using only those backends in the compute host.

The neutron in-tree SRIOV backend does not reliably send network-vif-plugged
event during plug time for ports with  ``direct`` vnic_type and never sends
that event for port with ``direct-physical`` vnic_type during plug time. For
other ``vnic_type`` and backend pairs, please consult the developers of the
backend.
