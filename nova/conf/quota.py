Recheck quota after resource creation to prevent allowing quota to be exceeded.

This defaults to True (recheck quota after resource creation) but can be set to
False to avoid additional load if allowing quota to be exceeded because of
racing requests is considered acceptable. For example, when set to False, if a
user makes highly parallel REST API requests to create servers, it will be
possible for them to create more servers than their allowed quota during the
race. If their quota is 10 servers, they might be able to create 50 during the
burst. After the burst, they will not be able to create any more servers but
they will be able to keep their 50 servers until they delete them.

The initial quota check is done before resources are created, so if multiple
parallel requests arrive at the same time, all could pass the quota check and
create resources, potentially exceeding quota. When recheck_quota is True,
quota will be checked a second time after resources have been created and if
the resource is over quota, it will be deleted and OverQuota will be raised,
usually resulting in a 403 response to the REST API user. This makes it
impossible for a user to exceed their quota with the caveat that it will,
however, be possible for a REST API user to be rejected with a 403 response in
the event of a collision close to reaching their quota limit, even if the user
has enough quota available when they made the request.
"""),

        'count_usage_from_placement',
        default=False,
        help="""
Enable the counting of quota usage from the placement service.

Starting in Train, it is possible to count quota usage for cores and ram from
the placement service and instances from the API database instead of counting
from cell databases.

This works well if there is only one Nova deployment running per placement
deployment. However, if an operator is running more than one Nova deployment
sharing a placement deployment, they should not set this option to True because
currently the placement service has no way to partition resource providers per
Nova deployment. When this option is left as the default or set to False, Nova
will use the legacy counting method to count quota usage for instances, cores,
and ram from its cell databases.

Note that quota usage behavior related to resizes will be affected if this
option is set to True. Placement resource allocations are claimed on the
destination while holding allocations on the source during a resize, until the
resize is confirmed or reverted. During this time, when the server is in
VERIFY_RESIZE state, quota usage will reflect resource consumption on both the
source and the destination. This can be beneficial as it reserves space for a
revert of a downsize, but it also means quota usage will be inflated until a
resize is confirmed or reverted.

Behavior will also be different for unscheduled servers in ERROR state. A
server in ERROR state that has never been scheduled to a compute host will
not have placement allocations, so it will not consume quota usage for cores
and ram.

Behavior will be different for servers in SHELVED_OFFLOADED state. A server in
SHELVED_OFFLOADED state will not have placement allocations, so it will not
consume quota usage for cores and ram. Note that because of this, it will be
possible for a request to unshelve a server to be rejected if the user does not
have enough quota available to support the cores and ram needed by the server
to be unshelved.

The ``populate_queued_for_delete`` and ``populate_user_id`` online data
migrations must be completed before usage can be counted from placement. Until
the data migration is complete, the system will fall back to legacy quota usage
counting from cell databases depending on the result of an EXISTS database
query during each quota check, if this configuration option is set to True.
Operators who want to avoid the performance hit from the EXISTS queries should
wait to set this configuration option to True until after they have completed
their online data migrations via ``nova-manage db online_data_migrations``.
