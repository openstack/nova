        Countable resources are those resources which directly

        A CountableResource must be constructed with a counting
        function, which will be called to determine the current counts
        of the resource.

        The counting function will be passed the context, along with
        the extra positional and keyword arguments that are passed to
        Quota.count_as_dict().  It should return a dict specifying the
        count scoped to a project and/or a user.

        Example count of instances, cores, or ram returned as a rollup
        of all the resources since we only want to query the instances
        table once, not multiple times, for each resource.
        Instances, cores, and ram are counted across a project and

        Example count of key pairs keeping a consistent format.
