[unit_tests]
# Set up any number of databases to test concurrently.
# The "name" used in the test is the config variable key.

# A few tests rely on one sqlite database with 'sqlite' as the key.

sqlite=sqlite://
#sqlitefile=sqlite:///test_migrations_utils.db
#mysql=mysql+mysqldb://user:pass@localhost/test_migrations_utils
#postgresql=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost/test_migrations_utils

[migration_dbs]
# Migration DB details are listed separately as they can't be connected to
# concurrently. These databases can't be the same as above

# Note, sqlite:// is in-memory and unique each time it is spawned.
# However file sqlite's are not unique.

sqlite=sqlite://
#sqlitefile=sqlite:///test_migrations.db
#mysql=mysql+mysqldb://user:pass@localhost/test_migrations
#postgresql=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost/test_migrations
