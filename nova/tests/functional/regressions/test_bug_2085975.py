        based on the instance.host.

        To be able to test it we need a bit of setup:
        * we need to ensure check_instance_shared_storage_local passes in
          the functional env instead of returning None and triggering skip of
          the remote check
        * we need to hook the check_instance_shared_storage RPC call to be
          able to assert its success / failure
        * we need to stop the evacuation on the dest compute at the right time
          when the migration record is already in progress and the
          instance.host is not yet set to the dest. We hook the libvirt
          driver's rebuild method to wait.
