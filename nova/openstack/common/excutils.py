    In some cases the exception context can be cleared, resulting in None
    being attempted to be re-raised after an exception handler is run. This
    can happen when eventlet switches greenthreads or when running an
    exception handler, code raises and catches an exception. In both
    cases the exception context will be cleared.

    To work around this, we save the exception state, run handler code, and
    then re-raise the original exception. If another exception occurs, the
    saved exception is logged and the new exception is re-raised.
