"""Possible actions on an instance.

Actions should probably match a user intention at the API level.  Because they
can be user visible that should help to avoid confusion.  For that reason they
tend to maintain the casing sent to the API.

Maintaining a list of actions here should protect against inconsistencies when
they are used.

The naming style of instance actions should be snake_case, as it will
consistent with the API names. Do not modify the old ones because they have
been exposed to users.
