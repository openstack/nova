Nova doesn't have maintainers in the same way as the Linux Kernel. However,
we do have sub-teams who maintain parts of Nova and a series of nominated
"czars" to deal with cross functional tasks.

Each of these sub-teams and roles are documented on our wiki at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova

You can find helpful contacts for many parts of our code repository at
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova#Developer_Contacts

We also have a page which documents tips and mentoring opportunities for new
Nova developers at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Mentoring

Finally, you should also check out our developer reference at
https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/contributor/index.html

Thanks for your interest in Nova, please come again!
