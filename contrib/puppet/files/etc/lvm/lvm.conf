    #
    # In the event of a failure, the specified policy will be used to determine
    # what happens. This applies to automatic repairs (when the mirror is being
    # monitored by dmeventd) and to manual lvconvert --repair when
    # --use-policies is given.
    #
    # "remove" - Simply remove the faulty device and run without it.  If
    #            the log device fails, the mirror would convert to using
    #            an in-memory log.  This means the mirror will not
    #            remember its sync status across crashes/reboots and
    #            the entire mirror will be re-synced.  If a
    #            mirror image fails, the mirror will convert to a
    #            non-mirrored device if there is only one remaining good
    #            copy.
    #
    # "allocate" - Remove the faulty device and try to allocate space on
    #            a new device to be a replacement for the failed device.
    #            Using this policy for the log is fast and maintains the
    #            ability to remember sync state through crashes/reboots.
    #            Using this policy for a mirror device is slow, as it
    #            requires the mirror to resynchronize the devices, but it
    #            will preserve the mirror characteristic of the device.
    #            This policy acts like "remove" if no suitable device and
    #            space can be allocated for the replacement.
    #
    # "allocate_anywhere" - Not yet implemented. Useful to place the log device
    #            temporarily on same physical volume as one of the mirror
    #            images. This policy is not recommended for mirror devices
    #            since it would break the redundant nature of the mirror. This
    #            policy acts like "remove" if no suitable device and space can
    #            be allocated for the replacement.
