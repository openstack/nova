# Master configuration file for the QEMU driver.
# All settings described here are optional - if omitted, sensible
# defaults are used.

# VNC is configured to listen on 127.0.0.1 by default.
# To make it listen on all public interfaces, uncomment
# this next option.
#
# NB, strong recommendation to enable TLS + x509 certificate
# verification when allowing public access
#
# vnc_listen = "0.0.0.0"


# Enable use of TLS encryption on the VNC server. This requires
# a VNC client which supports the VeNCrypt protocol extension.
# Examples include vinagre, virt-viewer, virt-manager and vencrypt
# itself. UltraVNC, RealVNC, TightVNC do not support this
#
# It is necessary to setup CA and issue a server certificate
# before enabling this.
#
# vnc_tls = 1


# Use of TLS requires that x509 certificates be issued. The
# default it to keep them in /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc. This directory
# must contain
#
#  ca-cert.pem - the CA master certificate
#  server-cert.pem - the server certificate signed with ca-cert.pem
#  server-key.pem  - the server private key
#
# This option allows the certificate directory to be changed
#
# vnc_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/pki/libvirt-vnc"


# The default TLS configuration only uses certificates for the server
# allowing the client to verify the server's identity and establish
# and encrypted channel.
#
# It is possible to use x509 certificates for authentication too, by
# issuing a x509 certificate to every client who needs to connect.
#
# Enabling this option will reject any client who does not have a
# certificate signed by the CA in /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc/ca-cert.pem
#
# vnc_tls_x509_verify = 1


# The default VNC password. Only 8 letters are significant for
# VNC passwords. This parameter is only used if the per-domain
# XML config does not already provide a password. To allow
# access without passwords, leave this commented out. An empty
# string will still enable passwords, but be rejected by QEMU
# effectively preventing any use of VNC. Obviously change this
# example here before you set this
#
# vnc_password = "XYZ12345"


# Enable use of SASL encryption on the VNC server. This requires
# a VNC client which supports the SASL protocol extension.
# Examples include vinagre, virt-viewer and virt-manager
# itself. UltraVNC, RealVNC, TightVNC do not support this
#
# It is necessary to configure /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf to choose
# the desired SASL plugin (eg, GSSPI for Kerberos)
#
# vnc_sasl = 1


# The default SASL configuration file is located in /etc/sasl2/
# When running libvirtd unprivileged, it may be desirable to
# override the configs in this location. Set this parameter to
# point to the directory, and create a qemu.conf in that location
#
# vnc_sasl_dir = "/some/directory/sasl2"




# The default security driver is SELinux. If SELinux is disabled
# on the host, then the security driver will automatically disable
# itself. If you wish to disable QEMU SELinux security driver while
# leaving SELinux enabled for the host in general, then set this
# to 'none' instead
#
# security_driver = "selinux"


# The user ID for QEMU processes run by the system instance
user = "root"

# The group ID for QEMU processes run by the system instance

# to match the configured user/group above. Defaults to 1.
# Set to 0 to disable file ownership changes.

# What cgroup controllers to make use of with QEMU guests
#
#  - 'cpu' - use for schedular tunables
#  - 'devices' - use for device whitelisting
#
# NB, even if configured here, they won't be used unless
# the adminsitrator has mounted cgroups. eg
#
#  mkdir /dev/cgroup
#  mount -t cgroup -o devices,cpu none /dev/cgroup
#
# They can be mounted anywhere, and different controlers
# can be mounted in different locations. libvirt will detect
# where they are located.
#
# cgroup_controllers = [ "cpu", "devices" ]

# This is the basic set of devices allowed / required by
# all virtual machines.
#
# As well as this, any configured block backed disks,
# all sound device, and all PTY devices are allowed.
#
# This will only need setting if newer QEMU suddenly
# wants some device we don't already know a bout.

# The default format for Qemu/KVM guest save images is raw; that is, the
# memory from the domain is dumped out directly to a file.  If you have
# guests with a large amount of memory, however, this can take up quite
# a bit of space.  If you would like to compress the images while they
# are being saved to disk, you can also set "lzop", "gzip", "bzip2", or "xz"
# for save_image_format.  Note that this means you slow down the process of
# saving a domain in order to save disk space; the list above is in descending
# order by performance and ascending order by compression ratio.
#
# save_image_format = "raw"

# If provided by the host and a hugetlbfs mount point is configured,
# a guest may request huge page backing.  When this mount point is
# unspecified here, determination of a host mount point in /proc/mounts
# will be attempted.  Specifying an explicit mount overrides detection
# of the same in /proc/mounts.  Setting the mount point to "" will
# disable guest hugepage backing.
#
# NB, within this mount point, guests will create memory backing files
# in a location of  $MOUNTPOINT/libvirt/qemu

# hugetlbfs_mount = "/dev/hugepages"

# mac_filter enables MAC addressed based filtering on bridge ports.
# This currently requires ebtables to be installed.
#
# mac_filter = 1

# By default, PCI devices below non-ACS switch are not allowed to be assigned
# to guests. By setting relaxed_acs_check to 1 such devices will be allowed to
# be assigned to guests.
