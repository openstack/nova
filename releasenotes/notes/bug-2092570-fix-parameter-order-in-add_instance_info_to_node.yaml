    Fixed an issue where the instance rebuild option failed for Ironic instances.
    The problem was caused by an incorrect parameter order in the ``add_instance_info_to_node``
    function, which was introduced by commit `93b90d2b` <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/nova/+/923910>.
    For more details, see `bug 2092570` <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2092570>.
