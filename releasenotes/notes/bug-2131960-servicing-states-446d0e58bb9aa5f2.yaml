    [`bug 2131960 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2131960>`_]
    Fixed improper teardown of Ironic nodes in servicing states.
    Previously, when Nova's virt driver called ``destroy()`` on Ironic
    nodes in certain states (``deploy hold``, ``servicing``, ``service wait``,
    ``service hold``, ``service failed``), these nodes would fail to undergo
    proper teardown, resulting in orphaned instances where instance metadata
    was removed but nodes remained unprovisioned in Ironic. In flat networking
    configurations, this could allow nodes traversing servicing states to
    briefly access tenant networks. In Neutron networking configurations,
    while VIFs would detach correctly, nodes would remain in Ironic with a
    shutdown IPA, and future deprovisioning attempts would fail due to missing
    networking metadata. These states are now properly handled to ensure
    complete node deprovisioning.

    [`bug 2131960 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2131960>`_]
    Fixed a bug where Ironic nodes in servicing-related provision states
    (``deploy hold``, ``servicing``, ``service wait``, ``service hold``,
    ``service failed``) were not properly unprovisioned when instances were
    destroyed. The Nova Ironic virt driver now correctly triggers
    unprovisioning for nodes in these states, preventing orphaned node
    configurations in Ironic.
