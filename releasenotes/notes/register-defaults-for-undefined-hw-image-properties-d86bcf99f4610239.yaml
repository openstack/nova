    Default image properties for device buses and models are now persisted in
    the instance system metadata for the following image properties:

    * ``hw_cdrom_bus``
    * ``hw_disk_bus``
    * ``hw_input_bus``
    * ``hw_pointer_model``
    * ``hw_video_model``
    * ``hw_vif_model``

    Instance device buses and models will now remain stable across reboots and
    will not be changed by new defaults in libosinfo or the OpenStack Nova
    libvirt driver.
