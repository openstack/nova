upgrade:
  - A new nova-manage command has been added which will upgrade a deployment to
    cells v2. Running the command will setup a single cell containing the
    existing hosts and instances. No data or instances will be moved during
    this operation, but new data will be added to the nova_api database.  New
    instances booted after this point will be placed into the cell.  Please
    note that this does not mean that cells v2 is fully functional at this
    time, but this is a significant part of the effort to get there.
    The new command is
    "nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup --transport_url <transport_url>"
    where transport_url is the connection information for the current message
    queue used by Nova. Operators must create a new database for cell0 before
    running `cell_v2 simple_cell_setup`. The simple cell setup command expects
    the name of the cell0 database to be `<main database name>_cell0` as it
    will create a cell mapping for cell0 based on the main database connection,
    sync the cell0 database, and associate existing hosts and instances with
    the single cell.
