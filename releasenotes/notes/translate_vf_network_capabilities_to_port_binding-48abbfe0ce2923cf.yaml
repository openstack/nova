    Previously ``switchdev`` capabilities should be configured manually by a
    user with admin privileges using port's binding profile. This blocked
    regular users from managing ports with Open vSwitch hardware offloading
    as providing write access to a port's binding profile to non-admin users
    introduces security risks. For example, a binding profile may contain a
    ``pci_slot`` definition, which denotes the host PCI address of the
    device attached to the VM. A malicious user can use this parameter to
    passthrough any host device to a guest, so it is impossible to provide
    write access to a binding profile to regular users in many scenarios.

    This patch fixes this situation by translating VF capabilities reported
    by Libvirt to Neutron port binding profiles. Other VF capabilities are
    translated as well for possible future use.
