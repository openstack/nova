upgrade:
  - |
    In the victoria release, the instance_numa_topology object
    was extended to enabled mix cpus (pinned and unpinned cpus)
    in the same instance. This change added a new field pcpuset
    to the instance_numa_topology object. While the change included
    object conversion code to handle the upgrade, it did not account
    for instances that have a numa_topology but were not pinned.
    i.e. a flavor with hw:mem_page_size or hw:numa_nodes set but
    without hw:cpu_policy set to dedicated. As a result, instances
    created between liberty and victoria releases with such a flavor
    cannot be started  after upgrade to victoria. This has now
    been fixed. instances created post victoria are not affected by
    this issue. see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2080556
    for more details.
