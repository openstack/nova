    The libvirt driver now allows specifying individual CPU feature
    flags for guests, via a new configuration attribute
    ``[libvirt]/cpu_model_extra_flags`` -- only with ``custom`` as the
    ``[libvirt]/cpu_model``.  Refer to its documentation in
    ``nova.conf`` for usage details.

    One of the motivations for this is to alleviate the performance
    degradation (caused as a result of applying the "Meltdown" CVE
    fixes) for guests running with certain Intel-based virtual CPU
    models.  This guest performance impact is reduced by exposing the
    CPU feature flag 'PCID' ("Process-Context ID") to the *guest* CPU,
    assuming that it is available in the physical hardware itself.

    Note that besides ``custom``, Nova's libvirt driver has two other
    CPU modes: ``host-model`` (which is the default), and
    ``host-passthrough``.  Refer to the
    ``[libvirt]/cpu_model_extra_flags`` documentation for what to do
    when you are using either of those CPU modes in context of 'PCID'.
