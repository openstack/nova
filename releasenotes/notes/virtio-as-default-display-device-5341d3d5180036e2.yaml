    From this release, Nova instances will get ``virtio`` as the default
    display device (instead of ``cirrus``, which has many limitations).
    If your guest has a native kernel (called "virtio-gpu" in Linux;
    available since  Linux 4.4 and above) driver, then it'll be used;
    otherwise, the 'virtio' model will gracefully fallback to VGA
    compatibility mode, which is still better than ``cirrus``.
