upgrade:
  - |
    The ``nova-console`` service has been deprecated since the 19.0.0 Stein
    release and has now been removed. The following configuration options are
    therefore removed.

    * ``[upgrade_levels] console``

    In addition, the following APIs have been removed. Calling these APIs will
    now result in a ``410 HTTPGone`` error response:

    * ``POST /servers/{server_id}/consoles``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/consoles``
    * ``GET /servers/{server_id}/consoles/{console_id}``
    * ``DELETE /servers/{server_id}/consoles/{console_id}``

    Finally, the following policies are removed. These were related to the
    removed APIs listed above and no longer had any effect:

    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:index``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:create``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:delete``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-consoles:show``
