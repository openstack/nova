upgrade:
  - All code and tests for Nova's EC2 and ObjectStore API support which
    was deprecated in Kilo
    (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReleaseNotes/Kilo#Upgrade_Notes_2) has
    been completely removed in Mitaka. This has been replaced by the new
    ec2-api project (http://opendev.org/openstack/ec2-api/).
