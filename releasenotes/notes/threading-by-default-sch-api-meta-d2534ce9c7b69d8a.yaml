    The default concurrency mode is now switched from eventlet to native
    threading for nova-scheduler, nova-api, and nova-metadata services.
    The concurrency mode can still be switched back to eventlet if needed.

    `concurrency <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/concurrency.html>`__
    guide for more details.
