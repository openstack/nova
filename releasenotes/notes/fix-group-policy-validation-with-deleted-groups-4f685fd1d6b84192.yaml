    When the server group policy validation upcall is enabled
    nova will assert that the policy is not violated on move operations
    and initial instance creation. As noted in `bug 1890244`_, if a
    server was created in a server group and that group was later deleted
    the validation upcall would fail due to an uncaught exception if the
    server group was deleted. This prevented evacuate and other move
    operations form functioning. This has now been fixed and nova will
    ignore deleted server groups.
