    Fixed the issue
    `bug 2044235 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2044235>`__ where Nova
    Conductor puts an instance into an error state if any errors occur during
    execution of the 'check_can_live_migrate_source()' method in an RPC call.
    Now, any error is caught and a MigrationPreCheckError exception is re-raised
    to reset the instance state.
