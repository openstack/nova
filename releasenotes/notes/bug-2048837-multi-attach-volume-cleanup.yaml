    When deleting multiple instances that share the same multi-attach volume
    on the same compute host in parallel, the volume connection could be left
    attached to the host even after all instances were deleted, preventing the
    volume from being properly detached and reused. Nova now correctly cleans
    up multi-attach volume connections when deleting instances, including when
    multiple instances sharing the same volume are deleted concurrently. For
    more details, see `bug 2048837 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2048837>`__.
