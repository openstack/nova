    The server-shares API policies have been updated to allow admin users
    (those with the role admin) to access them. There are no changes to the
    permissions for project users with the role reader/member. The following
    API policies have been updated from PROJECT_READER/PROJECT_MEMBER to
    PROJECT_READER_OR_ADMIN/PROJECT_MEMBER_OR_ADMIN to facilitate this change.

    * ``os_compute_api:os-server-shares:index`` → ``PROJECT_READER_OR_ADMIN``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-server-shares:create`` → ``PROJECT_MEMBER_OR_ADMIN``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-server-shares:show`` → ``PROJECT_READER_OR_ADMIN``
    * ``os_compute_api:os-server-shares:delete`` → ``PROJECT_MEMBER_OR_ADMIN``
