    The `bug 1856329`_ is fixed where the ``fault`` field was empty in the
    response of ``GET /servers/detail`` when instances were located in a nova
    cell DB. The ``InstanceList.fill_faults()`` method has been updated to use
    ``scatter_gather_all_cells()`` to properly retrieve faults from all cells,
    ensuring fault information is consistently returned regardless of which
    cell contains the instance.
