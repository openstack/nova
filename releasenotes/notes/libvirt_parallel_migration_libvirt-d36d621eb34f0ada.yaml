    Implemented parallel live migrations for libvirt driver, which can be
    enabled by defining ``[libvirt] live_migration_parallel_connections``
    to a value higher than 1.  By default parallel migrations are not used to
    preserve existing behavior. Also note that QEMU prior to 10.1.0 was not
    able to support multifd with postcopy migrations, so enabling these two
    features together on older QEMU versions is disallowed.
