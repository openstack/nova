    The WSGI scripts, ``nova-api-wsgi`` and ``nova-metadata-wsgi``, have been
    removed. Deployment tooling should instead reference the Python module
    paths for these services, ``nova.wsgi.osapi_compute`` and
    ``nova.wsgi.metadata``, if their chosen WSGI server supports this
    (gunicorn, uWSGI) or implement a ``.wsgi`` script themselves if not
    (mod_wsgi).
