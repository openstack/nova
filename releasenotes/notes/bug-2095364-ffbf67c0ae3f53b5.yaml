    `Bug #2095364`_: Fixed the List Server API and the List Server Detail API
    500 Internal Server Error issue in v2.96 or later API microversion if
    one or more instance has no request spec object. One usecase was when cloud
    user tried to create instance which exceeded their quota, the request does
    not create instance request spec. Once the no request spec instance is
    created in cloud user project, the server list API and the list server
    details API return 500 Internal Server Error for the project until the
    cloud user deletes the no request spec object instance.
    After this fix, the v2.96 or later returns `null` at the
    `pinned_availability_zone` value if not specified.
