    Before the `Bug 2078999 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2078999>`_ was fixed,
    the ``nova-manage image_property set`` command would update the image properties
    embedded in the instance but would not update the ones in the request specs. This
    led to an unexpected rollback of the image properties that were updated by the
    command after an instance migration.
