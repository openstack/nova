    `Bug 2127196`_ is fixed where Nova incorrectly generated a ``<blockio>``
    element in libvirt XML for LUN volumes when Cinder reported disk geometry
    (logical and physical block size). QEMU's ``scsi-block`` device driver
    does not support ``physical_block_size`` and ``logical_block_size``
    properties, causing instance spawn to fail with the error
    ``Property 'scsi-block.physical_block_size' not found``.
    The ``<blockio>`` element is now omitted for LUN devices.
