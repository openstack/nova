    The OpenStack 2024.1 (Nova 29.0.0) release includes many new features and
    bug fixes. Please be sure to read the upgrade section which describes the
    required actions to upgrade your cloud from 28.0.0 (2023.2) to 29.0.0
    (2024.1).
    As a reminder, OpenStack 2024.1 is a `Skip-Level-Upgrade Release`__
    (starting from now, we name it a `SLURP release`) meaning that you can
    do rolling-upgrade from 2023.1 and skip 2023.2.

    .. __: https://governance.openstack.org/tc/resolutions/20220210-release-cadence-adjustment.html

    There are a few major changes worth mentioning. This is not an exhaustive
    list:

    - The latest Compute API microversion supported for 2024.1 is `v2.96`__.

    - The Ironic driver ``[ironic]/peer_list`` configuration option has been
      deprecated. The Ironic driver now more closely models other Nova drivers
      where compute nodes do not move between compute service instances. If
      high availability of a single compute service is required, operators
      should use active/passive failover between 2 compute service agents
      configured to share the same compute service host
      value``[DEFAULT]/host``. Ironic nova-compute services can now be
      configured to target a specific shard of ironic nodes by setting the
      ``[ironic]/shard`` configuration option and a new ``nova-manage db
      ironic_compute_node_move`` command can help the operators when upgrading
      their computes to specify which shard they should manage.

    - Instances using `vGPUs can now be live-migrated
      <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/virtual-gpu.html#caveats>`_
      if both of the compute nodes support libvirt-8.6.0 and QEMU-8.1.0, as the
      source mediated device will migrate the GPU memory to another target
      mediated device automatically. In order to do this,
      ``[libvirt/live_migration_downtime`` config option needs to be modified
      according to the aforementioned documentation.

    - As of the new 2.96 microversion, the ``server show`` and ``server list``
      APIs now return a new parameter called ``pinned_availability_zone`` that
      indicates whether the instance is confined to a specific AZ. This field
      supplements the existing ``availability_zone`` field which reports the
      availability zone of the host where the service resides. The two values
      may be different if the service is shelved or is not pinned to an AZ
      which can help operators plan maintenance and better understand the
      workload constraints.

    - Instances using virtio-net will see an increase in performance between
      10% and 20% if their image uses a new ``hw_virtio_packed_ring=true``
      property or their flavor contains ``hw:virtio_packed_ring=true`` extra
      spec, provided libvirt version is >= 6.3 and QEMU >= 4.2.

    - As a security mechanism, a new ``[consoleauth]/enforce_session_timeout``
      configuration option provides the ability to automatically close a server
      console session when the token expires. This is disabled by default to
      preserve the existing behaviour for upgrades.

    - The libvirt driver now supports requesting a configurable memory address
      space for the instances. This allows `instances with large RAM
      requirements
      <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/2024.1/implemented/libvirt-maxphysaddr-support.html#flavor-extra-specs>`_
      to be created by specifying either ``hw:maxphysaddr_mode=emulate`` and
      ``hw:maxphysaddr_bits`` flavor extra specs or  ``hw_maxphysaddr_mode``
      and ``hw_maxphysaddr_bits``image properties. The
      ``ImagePropertiesFilter`` and ``ComputeCapabilitiesFilter`` filters are
      required to support this functionality.

    - The Hyper-V virt driver has been removed. It was deprecated in the Nova
      27.2.0 (Antelope) release. This driver was untested and has no
      maintainers. In addition, it had a dependency on the OpenStack Winstacker
      project that also has been retired.

    - A couple of other improvements target reducing the number of bugs we
      have: one automatically detecting the maximum number of instances with
      memory encryption which can run concurrently, another one allows
      specifying a specific IP address or hostname for incoming move operations
      (by setting ``[libvirt]/migration_inbound_addr``) and yet another one
      that improves stability of block device management using libvirt device
      aliases.
