    The nova (metadata)api wsgi application will now detect fatal errors
    (configuration, et al) on startup and lock into a permanent error state
    until fixed and restarted. This solves a problem with some wsgi runtimes
    ignoring initialization errors and continuing to send requests to the
    half-initialized service. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2103811
    for more details.
