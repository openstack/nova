    Nova operation with VIF type TAP was broken by a libvirt change (in 9.5.0)
    to treat TAP interface specifications as "managed" by default.  This means
    that libvirt expects to create the TAP interface itself, which is
    incompatible with how Nova works, because Nova creates the TAP interface
    before telling libvirt about it. In particular this broke OpenStack with
    Calico as the network plugin, because Calico uses VIF type TAP.

    This is now fixed, by Nova adding the `managed="no"` attribute to TAP
    interface XML specifications.

    See `bug 2033681`_ for more details.
