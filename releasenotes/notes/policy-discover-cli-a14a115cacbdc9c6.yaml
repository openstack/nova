  - The nova-policy command line is implemented as a tool to experience the
    under-development feature policy discovery. User can input the credentials
    information and the instance info, the tool will return a list of API which
    can be allowed to invoke. There isn't any contract for the interface of
    the tool due to the feature still under-development.
