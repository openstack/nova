    When live migration fails during pre_live_migration on the destination,
    during rollback Cinder volumes will now be disconnected from the
    destination locally instead of remotely over RPC from the source. This
    should ensure that only connection_info for the destination will be used to
    disconnect volumes from the destination.
    See `bug #1899835 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1899835>`_ for more
    details.
